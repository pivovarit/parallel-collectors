Parallel Collectors is a toolkit easining parallel collection processing in Java. 

## Rationale

Stream API is a great tool for collection processing especially if that involves parallelism of CPU-intensive tasks, for example:

    public static void parallelSetAll(int[] array, IntUnaryOperator generator) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(generator);
        IntStream.range(0, array.length).parallel().forEach(i -> { array[i] = generator.applyAsInt(i); });
    }
    
**All tasks managed by parallel Streams are executed on a shared `ForkJoinPool` instance**. 
Unfortunately, it's not the best choice for running blocking operations which could easily lead to the saturation of the common pool, and to serious performance degradation of everything that relies on it.

For example:

    List<String> result = list.parallelStream()
      .map(i -> fetchFromDb(i)) // runs implicitly on ForkJoinPool.commonPool()
      .collect(Collectors.toList());

A standard solution to the problem involves creating a separate thread pool and offloading the common pool from tasks executing blocking operations... but here's the catch.

**Sadly, Streams can run parallel computations only on the common `ForkJoinPool`** which effectively restricts the applicability of parallel Streams to CPU-bound jobs.

However, there's a trick that allows running parallel Streams in a custom FJP instance... but it's considered harmful:

> Note, however, that this technique of submitting a task to a fork-join pool to run the parallel stream in that pool is an implementation "trick" and is not guaranteed to work. Indeed, the threads or thread pool that is used for execution of parallel streams is unspecified. By default, the common fork-join pool is used, but in different environments, different thread pools might end up being used. 

Says [Stuart Marks on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28985704/parallel-stream-from-a-hashset-doesnt-run-in-parallel/29272776#29272776). 

Plus, that approach was seriously flawed before JDK-10 - if a `Stream` was targeted towards another pool, splitting would still need to adhere to the parallelism of the common pool, and not the one of the targeted pool [[JDK8190974]](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8190974).

## Philosophy

Parallel Collectors are unopinionated by design so it's up to users to use them responsibly, which involves things like:
- proper configuration of a provided `Executor` and its lifecycle management
- choosing the right parallelism level

Make sure to read API documentation before using these in production.

## Basic API

The main entrypoint to the libary is the `com.pivovarit.collectors.ParallelCollectors` class - which mirrors the `java.util.stream.Collectors` class and contains static factory methods returning `java.util.stream.Collector` implementations with parallel processing capabilities.

Since the library relies on a native `java.util.stream.Collector` mechanism, it was possible to achieve compatibility with Stream API without any intrusive interference.


#### Available `Collectors`:

`parallelToList`:

- `parallelToList(Executor executor)`
- `parallelToList(Executor executor, int parallelism)`
- `parallelToList(Function<T, R> mapper, Executor executor)`
- `parallelToList(Function<T, R> mapper, Executor executor, int parallelism)`

`parallelToSet`:

- `parallelToSet(Executor executor)`
- `parallelToSet(Executor executor, int parallelism)`
- `parallelToSet(Function<T, R> mapper, Executor executor)`
- `parallelToSet(Function<T, R> mapper, Executor executor, int parallelism)`

`parallelToCollection`:

- `parallelToCollection(Supplier<R> collection, Executor executor)`
- `parallelToCollection(Supplier<R> collection, Executor executor, int parallelism)`
- `parallelToCollection(Function<T, R> mapper, Supplier<C> collection, Executor executor)`
- `parallelToCollection(Function<T, R> mapper, Supplier<C> collection, Executor executor, int parallelism)`

Above can be used in conjunction with `Stream#collect` as any other `Collector` from `java.util.stream.Collectors`.
 
**By design, it's obligatory to supply a custom `Executor` instance and manage its lifecycle.**

**All those collectors are one-off and should not be reused unless you know what you're doing.**

### Leveraging CompletableFuture

All Parallel Collectors™ expose resulting `Collection` wrapped in `CompletableFuture` instances which provides great flexibility and possibility of working with them in a non-blocking fashion:

    CompletableFuture<List<String>> result = list.stream()
      .collect(parallelToList(i -> fetchFromDb(i), executor));

This makes it possible to conveniently apply callbacks, and compose with other `CompletableFuture`s:

    list.stream()
      .collect(parallelToList(i -> fetchFromDb(i), executor))
      .thenAccept(System.out::println)
      .thenRun(() -> System.out.println("Finished!"));
      
Or just `join()` if you just want to wait for the result:

    List<String> result = list.stream()
      .collect(parallelToList(i -> fetchFromDb(i), executor))
      .join();
      
What's more, since JDK9, [you can even provide own timeout](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html#get(long,java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)) (but you will need to handle a handful of exceptions).
      
## Examples

### 1. Parallelize and collect to List

#### with ParallelCollectors™

    Executor executor = ...

    List<String> result = list.stream()
      .collect(parallelToList(i -> fetchFromDb(i), executor))
      .join(); // on CompletableFuture<Set<String>>

#### with Parallel Streams
    List<String> result = list.parallelStream()
      .map(i -> fetchFromDb(i)) // runs implicitly on ForkJoinPool.commonPool()
      .collect(Collectors.toList());
      
### 2. Parallelize and collect to List non-blocking

#### with ParallelCollectors™

    Executor executor = ...

    CompletableFuture<List<String>> result = list.stream()
      .collect(parallelToList(i -> fetchFromDb(i), executor));
    
#### with Parallel Streams
    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
      
### 3. Parallelize and collect to List on a custom Executor

#### with ParallelCollectors™

    Executor executor = ...

    List<String> result = list.stream()
      .collect(parallelToList(i -> fetchFromDb(i), executor))
      .join(); // on CompletableFuture<Set<String>>
    
#### with Parallel Streams
    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### 4. Parallelize and collect to List and define parallelism

#### with ParallelCollectors™

    Executor executor = ...

    List<String> result = list.stream()
      .collect(parallelToList(i -> fetchFromDb(i), executor, 42))
      .join(); // on CompletableFuture<Set<String>>
    
#### with Parallel Streams
    System.setProperty("java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism", "42"); 
    
    // global settings ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    
    List<String> result = list.parallelStream()
      .map(i -> fetchFromDb(i)) // runs implicitly on ForkJoinPool.commonPool()
      .collect(Collectors.toList());

### Tips

- Name your thread pools
- Limit the size of working queues
